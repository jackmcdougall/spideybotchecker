# spideybotchecker

This program is desinged to check your windows discord client for the spideybot malware or any malware like it (https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-turned-into-an-info-stealing-backdoor-by-new-malware/). If the program incorrectly reports whether or not you have the malware it is not my problem.

The github project includes the compiled exe, and the source code if you want to compile your own version out of security concerns
